JavaScript,often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. <br>

The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
 It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O,
 such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.<br>

Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, 
and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.<br>
