C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".<br>

The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.  
It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, 
so it is available on many platforms.

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance,<br>
 efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts,
 with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), <br>
 and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probe
